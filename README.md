- 👋 Hi, I’m @vicon007
- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages and frameworks used for front end development and data analytics.
- 🌱 I currently use HTML5, CSS3, CSS Grid, Flexbox, SASS, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, React.js., SQL, MySQL, and Python.
I also build beautiful WordPress websites with Elementor and Divi.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting front end web/app projects and data analytics projects. I'm also open to hiring for full-time/part-time/contract/freelance projects.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email: victoronotu@gmail.com or my Instagram @vic_warriorking.
